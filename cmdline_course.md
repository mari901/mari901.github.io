# Command-Line Course Overview

This Command-Line Course promises to build foundational skills and extend to advanced concepts, such as scripting and web development with Jekyll and GitHub Pages, offering a vital skill set for any tech enthusiast.

## Week 1: Introduction to Command Line Environments

This week, we learned about setting up the command-line environment, which is essential for the entire course. I setup WSL2 with the help of the videos. 

Learned about basic fundamental commands like `ls` (list directory contents), `cd` (change directory), and `pwd` (print working directory) laid the groundwork for efficient navigation and task execution in the terminal. I also experimented with `nano`, a terminal-based text editor.

**Example Commands:**

- Navigating to a specific directory and listing its contents:

 ```console
  cd ~/KIK-LG221/week1
  ls -l
  ```
  This command changes the directory to `~/KIK-LG221/week1` and lists all files with detailed information.

- Using `echo` with output redirection to create a simple text file:

 ```console
  echo "Hello, Command Line World!" > greeting.txt
  ```
  This command outputs the text into a file named `greeting.txt`, demonstrating how commands can be used to manipulate files effortlessly.
